Can he really be 30 years old? Has it been that long since he was a chubby kid blowing fastballs by frustrated hitters, screaming in celebration of strikeouts and enchanting Mariners fans with his dominance and talent?

The King turned 30 on Friday. Yes, Felix Hernandez has reached an age that all people in their 20s deem "ancient."

Like most 29-year-olds, he seemed to handle it well in the days leading up to the seminal birthday. Just don't call him old.

"No, no, no, don't go there," he said this week. "I don't want to think about turning 30."

In some ways Hernandez seems older because he is in his 12th big-league season. He made his debut on Aug. 4, 2005. Since then he has started 335 games and amassed 2,2681 / 3 innings for a 143-102 record with a 3.11 ERA and 2,148 strikeouts.

There have also been six All-Star appearances, Cy Young runner-up finishes in 2009 and 2014 and a Cy Young Award in 2010.

He also has signed two contract extensions to remain with the team that signed him as a 16-year-old out of Venezuela.

"It is amazing," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "The first time I saw Felix Hernandez was the year I was scouting. I was working for (current Mariners general manager) Jerry Dipoto with the Rockies. One of the teams I had was the Tacoma club. So I flew up there, and I was following the club and Felix Hernandez was pitching. I just said, ‘Wow.' He was 19 years old. Just a few years earlier I had caught Kerry Wood in his rookie year (with the Chicago Cubs), and I said, ‘This guy is better than Kerry Wood.' "

Arm troubles dimmed Wood's rise to stardom. He later returned as closer and had some success.
