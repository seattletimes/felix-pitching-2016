### Proud of durability

Hernandez was the opposite. Beyond his stuff and talent, the durability has been outstanding. He has made 30 or more starts in each of the past 10 seasons and has not pitched less than 190 innings a season during that span. Hernandez has logged more than 200 innings in his past eight seasons. Of all his individual statistics, the 30-start, 200-inning barriers are most important to him.

"That's what I like," he said. "I want to throw as many innings as I can. After the season's over, you want to look up and know that you've thrown over 200 innings. That's the most important goal as a pitcher."

That consistency is something most people marvel at.

"At the time, I didn't know much about Felix," Servais said. "He was 19 and just really, really special. It's not surprising he's had the career he's had with the stuff he's had. Staying healthy, the longevity, running out every fifth day and his track record really says a lot to what he's been able to do. But it seems crazy to think he's 30 years old."

But don't call him old. Any gray hairs that might've have appeared on his head have been crushed by a much-discussed bleach/dye job.

He thinks of himself as young.

"I don't feel like I'm 30," he said. "I feel like I'm 22."

There's a reason for that. Hernandez shed his chubbiness a few years into his career. And he has kept it off, understanding that his body would change with each passing year.

"You have to work harder, because you aren't 21 anymore," he said. "You have to increase your offseason program and be more aggressive with your offseason workouts."

Those workouts that are core and leg centric have helped him battle the fatigue and soreness that seems to come more often as a person ages.

"I feel the same as I did when I was 21," he said. "I don't feel any different. I have my own routine. I do a lot of stuff in the training room and in the weight room, and it's why I feel that way."

Hernandez was blunt about his career path had he not changed his offseason routine and eating habits.

"I probably wouldn't be pitching right now," he said. "To be pitching that long in the big leagues, you have to a have a real routine and have a good workout program."
