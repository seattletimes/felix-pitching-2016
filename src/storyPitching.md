### "I know how to pitch"

But you also have to evolve. Hernandez is no longer the flamethrower of his youth. He has become a pitcher. When he fiddled around with a circle changeup grip during the 2009 season and decided to start throwing it in games, he became an artist on the mound. It soon became his best pitch and changed his approach to attacking hitters.

The emergence of the changeup loomed more important with the steady decline of his fastball velocity. He no longer rifles fastballs in the mid to high 90s. His average fastball the last four seasons has been right around 92 mph. Also as he matured, his reliance on the fastball has dwindled. In 2008 he threw it 65.9 percent of the time. Last season, he threw it 38.7 percent of the time.

"I know how to pitch now," he said.

Even at 30, Hernandez believes he has good years ahead of him. He hopes to pitch in a postseason game — something he has never done. To do that, he'll have to be better than last season. He went 18-9 with a 3.53 ERA in 2015 — good numbers for most pitchers, not for him. He fell short of 200 strikeouts for the first time in six seasons. He also had a handful of brutal starts in which he was shelled and knocked out of the game early

"It was a disappointing," he said. "I was inconsistent last year. You know it's a new season, and I'm trying to forget about that one and be ready for this one."

Don't call him old.

"I'm only going to be 30," he said. "I'm not 40."
