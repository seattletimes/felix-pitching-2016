    "description": "Once his primary weapon, Hernandez now throws it less than one-third of the time. His fastball velocity has dropped from an average of 96.3 mph in 2007 to 92.1 mph in 2015. But if located properly, it’s still an effective pitch because of its natural movement. The pitch occasionally will cut toward left-handed hitters.",

    "description": "Latin players refer to it as “cambio,” and it is his best pitch. Unlike many pitchers, Hernandez throws his changeup nearly as hard as a fastball in terms of velocity. But his arm speed and the pitch’s sinking motion leave hitters guessing. It’s his best pitch for getting a swing and a miss with two strikes.",
